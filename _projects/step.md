<h4>Leveraging Data Analytics to Revolutionize Project-Based Learning (PBL) in Education</h4>

<em>"On this research journey, as we explored the dynamics of Project-Based Learning adoption among educators in Massachusetts, the thrill of unearthing influential variables felt incredibly fulfilling. The experience of co-authoring a research paper destined for the AERA conference added a new layer to my academic journey. Instrumental in enhancing a software system that hosts PBL content, I eagerly anticipate extending my contributions into the fall with a focus on sophisticated quantitative analysis for our upcoming paper on place-based learning."</em>
