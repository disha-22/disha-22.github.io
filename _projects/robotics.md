<h6> Key Milestones </h6>
> <b>Regional Finalist:</b> Secured finalist position at the <a href="https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/team/972">  2019 FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)</a> <br><br> <b>Versatility in Engineering:</b> Led and contributed to the full lifecycle of robotic designâ€”from initial concept to competition-ready deployment. <br><br> <b>Community Engagement:</b> Participated in community outreach initiatives, showcasing our robot at local elementary schools to inspire the next generation of engineers.

<h6> Leadership and Soft Skills </h6>
> Project Management, Cross-Functional Teamwork, Technical Presentations, Strategic Design Reviews, Competitive Strategy Development, Fundraising & Financial Stewardship, Community Engagement

<h6> Engineering Skills </h6>
> Strategy-Driven Robot Prototyping & Design, CAD Modeling via SolidWorks, Hands-On Robot Assembly, Systematic Troubleshooting


<h6> Project Insights </h6>
> <b>Holistic Engineering:</b> Contributed to each stage of robot design, from conception to competition-readiness. Involved in designing and prototyping various robotic systems such as drive-trains, intake/outtake mechanisms, elevators, and vision systems, all while adhering to stringent competition regulations outlined in the <a href="https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2020/Manual/2020FRCGameSeasonManual.pdf"> FRC Game Manual </a>.  
<br> <b>Cutting-Edge Manufacturing:</b> Utilized school's machine shop to fabricate designs, employing advanced tools such as CNC machines and lathes. The iterative process included meticulous assembly, testing, and design optimization.
<br><br> <b>Design Contributions: </b> Engineered the intake design and prototype for the 2019 robot, as seen in the bottom right image and in action at the competition (left image). Devised ball storage and conveyor assembly for the 2020 robot (competition cancelled due to COVID-19).
<br><br> <b>Leadership Initiatives:</b> Executed grant-writing efforts and helped with outreach to local businesses. Managed budgetary spreadsheets and orchestrated component procurement. Participated efforts to demo our robot at elementary schools, fueling young minds' curiosity in engineering.
