<h4> Unlocking the Essentials of Engineering Through Real-World Applications </h4>
<br>
<em>"My initiation into the STEM field took place through this transformative three-week residential <a href="https://cty.jhu.edu/programs/on-campus/courses/investigations-in-engineering-ienh"> summer program </a> at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The program immersed me in foundational engineering theories, which were immediately put to the test in tangible projects such as constructing bridges, designing roller coasters, and building hydraulic robots within set limitations. This experience catalyzed my passion for solving complex problems through engineering paradigms."</em>
