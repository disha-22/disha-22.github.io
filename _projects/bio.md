<h4>Bioinformatics Pipeline applied to Transcriptomics: From Quality Control to Functional Analysis</h4>

An extremely challenging project that helped me get an understanding of the Bioinformatics pipeline used for DNA microarray data.
With the knowledge and confidence gained from this internship, I am now trying out variations of the pipeline used in the internship to further deepen my understanding of Bioinformatics. 
I am also sharing my passion by introducing high school students to Bioinformatics and Data Science.

<h6> Details </h6>
> <b>Data collection:</b> Acquired datasets from the GEO Database (<a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/?acc=GSE18105"> GSE18105 </a>) and converted into the required R format to recreate the results from the following scientific paper: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7228005/"> Construction and Analysis of a ceRNA Network Reveals Potential Prognostic Markers in Colorectal Cancer</a>
<br><br> <b>Data analysis:</b> Installing and using Bioconductor packages needed for statistical analysis ( for removing outliers ), normalization, and gene expression analysis. 
<br><br> <b>Functional analysis:</b>
<br> Drawing statistically significant correlations between disease and genes expressed. Specifically, identifying genes that could be potential prognostic markers for colorectal cancer.
