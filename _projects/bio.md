<h4>Bioinformatics Pipeline applied to Transcriptomics: From Quality Control to Functional Analysis</h4>

An extremely challenging project that helped me get an understanding of the bioinformatics pipeline used when dealing with DNA microarray data.
Using the knowledge and confidence gained from this internship, I am now trying out variations of the pipeline used and teaching a workshop to introduce high school students to Bioinformatics.
