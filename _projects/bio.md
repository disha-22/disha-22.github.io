<h4>Bioinformatics Pipeline applied to Transcriptomics: From Quality Control to Functional Analysis</h4>

An extremely challenging project that helped me get an understanding of the Bioinformatics pipeline used for DNA microarray data.
With the knowledge and confidence gained from this internship, I am now trying out variations of the pipeline used in the internship to further deepen my understanding of Bioinformatics. 
And I am sharing my passion by introducing high school students to Bioinformatics via an online workshop.
