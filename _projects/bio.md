<h4>Bioinformatics Pipeline applied to Transcriptomics: From Quality Control to Functional Analysis</h4>

This was an extremely challenging project that helped me get an understanding of the Bioinformatics pipeline used for DNA microarray data. The knowledge and confidence gained from this internship is enabling me to experiment with variations of the pipeline to deepen my understanding of Bioinformatics.

<br>DGE Analysis ( Annotation, Gene filtering, Limma Analysis, Volcano plots ) <br>Functional Analysis ( GO, KEGG, STRING database )

<h6> Industry Tools </h6>
> GitHub, R Studio, Asana, GSuite

<h6> Details </h6>
> <b>Data collection:</b> Acquired datasets from the GEO Database (<a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/?acc=GSE18105"> GSE18105 </a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE21510"> GSE21510 </a>) to recreate the results from the following scientific paper: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7228005/"> Construction and Analysis of a ceRNA Network Reveals Potential Prognostic Markers in Colorectal Cancer</a>
<br><br> <b>Data analysis:</b> Installed and used Bioconductor packages to normalize the data and remove outliers.
<br><br> <b>Statistical analysis:</b> Used statistical methods to perform differential gene expression analysis. 
<br><br> <b>Functional analysis:</b> Drew statistically significant correlations between disease and genes expressed. Specifically, identified genes that could be potential prognostic markers for colorectal cancer.
