<h4>Transformative Approaches in Bioinformatics: Mastering Transcriptomics from Quality Control to Functional Analysis</h4>

<em>"This challenging project offered me a profound immersion into the realm of Bioinformatics, specifically tailored to DNA microarray data analysis. Capitalizing on this experience, I have experimented with pipeline variations, thereby deepening my understanding of this field. To democratize access to this valuable knowledge, I founded 'The Bioinformatics Academy,' an online platform designed to incrementally build computational proficiencies until students can execute a complete bioinformatics pipeline."</em>

> The Bioinformatics Academy 
<br> Fall 2020 - Winter 2021
<br> Launched a pioneering introductory course aimed at dismantling barriers to computational sciences, particularly for underrepresented groups. <a href="https://beginnerbioinformatics.com/courses/the-pipeline/lessons/top-table-visualizations">Access a sample module from the online workshop here</a>. The course has gained traction across six educational institutions in the U.S. and India.
