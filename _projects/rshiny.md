<h4>An R Shiny educational app to guide users through a interactive transcriptomics pipeline</h4>

<em>"My most enjoyable moments were when tasks/the project in general began to function how I hoped. For example, after a two or so weeks of the project, working with Sam and Nikita for setting up the project's outline the initial chaos of the project began to settle as participants got a better understanding of our goal. Seeing things beginning to run smoothly was very rewarding as a project management lead. Similarly, when I got R Shiny code that I worked on for a while to work (e.g., my volcano plot), I felt overjoyed."</em>

<h6> Details </h6>
> <b>sMAP</b> was made to help users understand a standard transcriptomics pipeline by taking them through the steps of microarray analysis. sMAP has an interactive user interface where users upload a GEO dataset and explore functions for quality control, statistical analysis, and functional analysis to find potential biomarkers.

> sMAP’s development team was brought together via STEM-Away, a platform for virtual internships. Our team is made up of participants in STEM-Away’s bioinformatics pathway who wanted to challenge themselves by taking on the R Shiny App project. We organized our team into five groups, respectively in charge of developing code for the transcriptomics pipeline, implementing code in R Shiny, formatting the layout of the R Shiny App, managing GitHub and code documentation, and producing this GitHub page and our documentation site.
