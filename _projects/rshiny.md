<h4>An R Shiny educational app to guide users through a interactive transcriptomics pipeline</h4>

<em>"My most enjoyable moments were when tasks/the project in general began to function how I hoped. For example, after a two or so weeks of the project, working with Sam and Nikita for setting up the project's outline the initial chaos of the project began to settle as participants got a better understanding of our goal. Seeing things beginning to run smoothly was very rewarding as a project management lead. Similarly, when I got R Shiny code that I worked on for a while to work (e.g., my volcano plot), I felt overjoyed."</em>

<h6> Highlights </h6>
> <b>Career Foundations:</b> Got a solid start on the fundamentals of applying big-data computing techniques to drive advances in fighting diseases such as Alzheimer's and cancer.
<br><br> <b>Featured Speaker:</b> Was selected as one of the presenters in the STEMaway Showcase event featuring top high school students. Video embedded below.
<br><br> <b>Community Contributions:</b> Used the knowledge from this internship to create a workshop to introduce the fundamentals of Bioinformatics and Data Science to High School students. Currently working on scaling the workshop to an <a  href="https://beginnerbioinformatics.com"> e-workshop (https://beginnerbioinformatics.com). </a>

<h6> Soft Skills </h6>
> Project Management, Leadership, Onboarding Assistance, Feedback Collection, Teamwork, Technical Presentation,Self-Assessment, Time and Task Management, Troubleshooting

<h6> Bioinformatics Skills </h6>
> <b>R Shiny ( Reactive Inputs & Outputs )</b>
<br> <b>Bioconductor R Packages and GEO Database</b> <br>Quality Control ( RLE boxplots, NUSE boxplots ) <br>Data visualization ( PCA, Heatmaps, Volcano plots )
<br>DGE Analysis ( Annotation, Gene filtering, Limma Analysis, Volcano plots ) <br>Functional Analysis ( GO, KEGG, STRING database )

<h6> Industry Tools </h6>
> GitHub, R Shiny, R Studio, Trello, GSuite, Airtable, Typeform

<h6> Details </h6>
> <b>sMAP</b> was made to help users understand a standard transcriptomics pipeline by taking them through the steps of microarray analysis. sMAP has an interactive user interface where users upload a GEO dataset and explore functions for quality control, statistical analysis, and functional analysis to find potential biomarkers.

> sMAP’s development team was brought together via STEM-Away, a platform for virtual internships. Our team is made up of participants in STEM-Away’s bioinformatics pathway who wanted to challenge themselves by taking on the R Shiny App project. We organized our team into five groups, respectively in charge of developing code for the transcriptomics pipeline, implementing code in R Shiny, formatting the layout of the R Shiny App, managing GitHub and code documentation, and producing this GitHub page and our documentation site.
