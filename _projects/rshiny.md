<h4>R Shiny App for Streamlined Transcriptomics: A Hands-On User Journey in Microarray Analysis</h4>

<em>"My most enjoyable moments were when tasks/the project in general began to function how I hoped. For example, after a two or so weeks of the project, working with Sam and Nikita for setting up the project's outline the initial chaos of the project began to settle as participants got a better understanding of our goal. Seeing things beginning to run smoothly was very rewarding as a project management lead. Similarly, when I got R Shiny code that I worked on for a while to work (e.g., my volcano plot), I felt overjoyed."</em>

<h6> Project Insights </h6>
> <b>About sMAP:</b> Developed to demystify the complexities of a standard transcriptomics pipeline, sMAP presents an interactive interface allowing users to upload GEO datasets. They can then engage in quality control, statistical analysis, and functional scrutiny to unearth potential biomarkers.

> <b>Team Dynamics:</b> The project was conceived and executed through STEM-Away’s virtual internship platform. Our multi-faceted team, categorized into five specialized units, took charge of distinct roles—from coding the transcriptomics pipeline and integrating it into the R Shiny app, to GitHub management and documentation.
