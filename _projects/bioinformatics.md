<h4>Bioinformatics Pipeline applied to Transcriptomics: From Quality Control to Functional Analysis</h4>

I participated in the STEM-Away Bioinformatics pathway educational internship and learned about the general workflow of bioinformatics research when dealing with microarray data. With guidance from internship mentors and leads, I performed batch correction, quality control, phenotypic analysis, differential gene expression analysis, and functional analysis (gene ontology, GSEA, transcriptional factor analysis, survival analysis) on the GSE8761 and GSE32323 datasets found in the GEO database. The goal of this internship project was to identify genes that could be potential prognostic markers for colorectal cancer based on the analyses mentioned above and to gain experience with a general bioinformatics workflow. In addition to utilizing various Bioconductor R packages (affy, limma, clusterProfiler, etc.) I became familiar with external functional analysis tools such as Metascape, DAVID, EnrichR, STRING, and GEPIA and different collaboration channels such as GSuite, GitHub, Asana, Slack, and STEM-Awayâ€™s own forums.

Throughout this internship, I enhanced my independent work ethic by managing my own time and working remotely while also communicating as part of a collaborative team with the other interns in order to give insightful presentations and troubleshoot challenges that arose in coding and the understanding of the methods.
