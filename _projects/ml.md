<h4>Recommendation and Classification Systems using Natural Language Processing</h4>


<hr>
  
<h6> Highlights </h6>
> End-to-end execution of a Machine Learning project from data collection to training models to deployment.
<br><br> Familiarity with new technologies such as Bidirectional Representation for Transformers (BERT), that was proposed by Google Research in 2018.

<h6> Soft Skills </h6>
> Finding relevant resources, Time and Task Management, Troubleshooting, Self-motivation

<h6> Machine Learning Skills </h6>
> Recommender Systems, Classification Systems, TF-IDF, BERT
<h6> Industry Tools </h6>
> Colab, Anaconda, StreamLit, GitHub

<h6> Details </h6>
> <b>Data Collection</b>: Used Beautiful Soup and Selenium to get data from DiscourseHub Community forums.
<br><br> <b>Exploratory Data Analysis:</b> Studied how pre-processing affects performance of different models.
<br><br> <b>Calculate similarity between posts and recommend posts/ classify posts:</b> Implemented TF-IDF to obtain features in the form of vectorized matrix. Used BERT to overcome the shortcomings of TF-IDF in classifying an unlabelled post.
<br><br> <b>Deployment:</b> Building a simple web app using Streamlit.
