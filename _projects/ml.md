> Collect the data: We will pick the DiscourseHub Community forums as our main data resource. You can either scrap one or several forums.
Explore your data (EDA): After gathering our data, we will analyze it to understand the data and get familiar with it before feeding it to ML models.
Calculate similarity between posts and recommend: We will vectorize our data, and compute the similarity matrix then use it to recommend posts similar to a certain post.
Train ML classifiers and classify a post into its appropriate category.
Compare and choose the best approach: evaluate the results of step 3 and 4 and choose the best one.
Build a simple web app using Flask or Streamlit.
Deploy your web app using AWS or Heroku or some other service
